Notifications App is a modern mobile application built with React Native and TypeScript that simulates a real-world push notification system. The app is designed to showcase best practices in mobile UI/UX, state management, and navigation.
With this app, users can:
- Receive and view notifications in a clean, inbox-style list.
- Distinguish between read and unread notifications at a glance.
- Tap any notification to see its full details and automatically mark it as read.
- Generate mock notifications of different types (info, warning, error, etc.) for testing and demonstration purposes.
- Manage their notification inbox: mark all as read, clear all, and see a badge with the count of unread notifications.
- Enjoy a responsive, mobile-friendly interface with a centralized color palette for easy theming.
